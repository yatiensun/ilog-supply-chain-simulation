# i-Log Supply Chain Simulation (12 Periods)

## Overview
This project simulates end-to-end supply chain decisions over **12 periods**.  
In each period, the decisions include:
- **Upstream:** purchase raw materials  
- **Production:** decide production quantity  
- **Downstream:** ship finished products to stores  

The objective is to balance **service level, inventory, and cash flow** while improving overall performance.

## Approach
- Defined decision rules for purchasing, production, and distribution
- Tracked KPIs across periods (inventory, shipments, stockouts/service level, cash/capital)
- Compared outcomes and summarized insights in charts

## Tools
- Excel (model tracking, charts)

## Deliverables
